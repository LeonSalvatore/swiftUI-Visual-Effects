# SwiftUI Visual Effects

A curated collection of modern, high-performance visual effects built using SwiftUI. This project serves as a demonstration of advanced interface techniques, showcasing how SwiftUI can be extended to deliver visually compelling, dynamic user experiences.

## Overview

**SwiftUI Visual Effects** provides a set of reusable components and modifiers designed to enhance the visual appeal of your iOS applications. From custom blur layers to interactive animations and light-based rendering effects, the goal is to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs achievable with native SwiftUI APIs.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Native SwiftUI implementation with no third-party dependencies
- ‚ú® Custom blur, vibrancy, and translucency effects
- üí° Light and shadow simulations using Metal and CoreAnimation
- üåà Gradient overlays and masking techniques
- üß© Reusable and composable components
- üì± Fully responsive across devices and screen sizes

## Requirements

- macOS 13 or later
- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 17 or later
- Swift 5.9+
